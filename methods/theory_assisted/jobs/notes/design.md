# Design — Candidate A (Iterated Greedy + VND), v1

**Status:** first heuristic, implemented in
[`iterated_greedy_vnd.py`](../iterated_greedy_vnd.py)
(`IteratedGreedyVNDJobSolver`, label `iterated_greedy_vnd`).
**Picked from:** [synthesis.md](synthesis.md) → Candidate A (IG+VND), the
recommended starting point.

## Two-layer architecture

Per the synthesis convergent theme *separation of position assignment from
job timing*:

1. **Outer** decision = assignment `pi : R → P` + a global priority order.
2. **Inner** decision = a deterministic **decoder** (assignment, order) →
   job start/finish times.

## v1 decoder: zero-movement by construction

The hard part of paper #2 is the κ feedback loop: a Mode-C interruption
extends a front aircraft's job, which shifts its finish, which shifts
same-position successors and the access windows seen by rear aircraft.
To get a correct first heuristic without solving that fixpoint, v1 uses a
**zero-movement decoding rule**:

> For each blocking arc `(front, rear)`, the rear aircraft's entry and
> exit must each be **Mode A** relative to the front stay — i.e. the rear
> is placed **before**, **after**, or **enclosing** the front (margins
> `eta`). Aircraft on the same position are separated by ≥ `epsilon`
> (RQ08). Aircraft on non-conflicting positions run fully in parallel.

Under this rule every rear access instant falls outside the front
aircraft's stay ⇒ the checker classifies it **Mode A** ⇒
`movements = 0`, `kappa = 0`, no timing feedback. The decoder is an
earliest-feasible-start list scheduler (jobs packed tight in chain
order); `_forbidden()` emits the infeasible start-time bands per placed
neighbour, leaving a feasible *hole* for the nesting option. Feasibility
is guaranteed and confirmed by `checker.py` on every run (RQ01–RQ09 PASS).

**Nesting / containment (the key relaxation).** Allowing the rear to
*enclose* the front (rather than only before/after, as the first cut did)
lets blocking-related aircraft overlap in time whenever one is long
enough to wrap the other. This is what breaks the full-serialisation
bottleneck on tight-blocking topologies — still at zero movements. On the
benchmark it pulls the heuristic up to the MILP optimum on R5
(triangle_R5_s1/s2: makespan 30 / 37, delay 0 — matching the MILP exactly)
and to within ~5 % makespan of the MILP on triangle_R10 while using
**0 manoeuvres vs the MILP's 8–10**.

**What this optimises:** `makespan` and `total_delay` only (movements are
always 0), via the choice of assignment and order. The IG+VND loop searches
that space.

## IG + VND loop

- **Construction:** NEH order (longest `T_r` first) + greedy best-position
  insertion (each aircraft placed at the position minimising the partial
  objective).
- **VND (B-VND reset)** over three neighbourhoods, first-improvement:
  N1 reassign one aircraft, N2 swap two aircraft's positions, N3 swap two
  aircraft in the priority order.
- **Perturbation (Iterated Greedy):** remove the `k = max(1, R//4)` highest
  -contribution aircraft (delay-weighted, lightly randomised), greedily
  reinsert each at its best (position, order-slot).
- **Acceptance:** accept-if-not-worse for the walk; track global best
  separately; restart the walk from best every 50 stale iterations.
  Early-stop after `max_no_improve` (default 400) non-improving iterations.

## Remaining gap (drives the next iteration)

Even with nesting, the heuristic never *spends* a manoeuvre: it stays at
zero movements by construction. On tight-blocking instances the MILP still
edges ahead by buying a few Mode-B/C manoeuvres to compress the schedule
further (triangle_R10: MILP makespan 59.5 with 8 manoeuvres vs IG+VND 62.5
with 0). The residual makespan gap (~5 %) is exactly that trade the
heuristic cannot yet make.

**Next iteration (v3):** add an incremental κ fixpoint to the decoder so the
VND can evaluate Mode-B/C overlap moves, letting it trade a manoeuvre for a
shorter makespan when the weights reward it. The VND neighbourhoods and the
IG loop stay as-is; only the decoder gains the manoeuvre-spending branch.
